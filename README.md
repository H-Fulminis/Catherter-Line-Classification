# Catherter-Line-Classification

This repo is dedicated to code for my project named **Prediction of Mal-positioned Catheter Lines in X-ray Radiographs using Deep Learning**.
<br>
The project is aimed at classifying the correct placement of different types of tubes using chest X-rays. Th problem was introduced as a Kaggle Competition named RANZCR CLiP - Catheter and Line Position Challenge
